These are csv exports of the processed views of the SQL database provided for convenience.


filtered-character-data 

This is basically the same as cleaned-character-data but users with full kanji-proficiency are removed (since they cannot be expected to learn anything) as well as the first iteration of any character since this is where the participants first encounter the character and so sonification will have had little effect at that point.


user-stats

These are some statistics on a per user and session basis such as the mean number of tries per stroke, the number of characters for which audio was disabled and the number of iterations made that session.


user-audio-stats

These are similar to the above but split into the characters where audio was disabled and not.


session-stats

This table contains the confidence intervals for each session and statistic.
